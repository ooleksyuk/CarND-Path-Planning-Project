## The Goal of this Project

In this project, your goal is to design a path planner that is able to create smooth, safe paths for the car 
to follow along a 3 lane highway with traffic. A successful path planner will be able to keep inside its lane, 
avoid hitting other cars, and pass slower moving traffic all by using localization, sensor fusion, and map 
data.

Included in the submission should be a writeup, either in the README or a seperate file that details how the 
project was completed.

A great writeup should include the rubric points as well as your description of how you addressed each point. 
You should include a detailed description of the code used in each step (with line-number references and code 
snippets where appropriate) and links to other supporting documents or external references.

All that said, please be concise! We're not looking for you to write a book, just a brief description of how 
you passed each rubric point, and references to the relevant code :)
